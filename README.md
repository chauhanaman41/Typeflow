# Typeflow
The goal of TypeFlow is to provide a clean, distraction-free typing speed testing experience without a traditional input box. Users type directly on the displayed text, receiving real-time visual feedback through opacity and color changes.

### Run Locally (Simple)

### Local Development Server (Recommended)
For the best experience (and to avoid CORS issues if we add more features), use a local server:

Using VS Code:
1. Install the "Live Server" extension.
2. Right-click `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server**.

Using Python:
```bash
# If you have Python installed
python -m http.server
# Then open http://localhost:8000
```
